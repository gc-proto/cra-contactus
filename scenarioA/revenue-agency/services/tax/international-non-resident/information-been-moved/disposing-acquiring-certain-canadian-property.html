        <h3>Do I need a taxation number?</h3>
<p><strong>Individuals</strong></p>
<p>All non-resident individuals who dispose of a property and who are required to notify the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of the disposition should have a Canadian taxation number.</p>
<p>If you are a former resident of Canada, this taxation number is your Social Insurance Number (SIN). If you had a SIN but don't remember it, please ensure you state this on the notification form along with your date of birth, your complete legal name, and the address you lived at in Canada prior to emigrating.</p>
<p>If you do not have a SIN but previously filed a Canadian income tax return, you may have been assigned a Temporary Tax Number (TTN) or an Individual Tax Number (ITN).</p>
<p>If you do not have a Canadian SIN, TTN, or ITN you should complete <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">Form T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents</a>. Send it to the CRA in advance of the disposition if possible. Otherwise, attach it to any of the <a href="#WhenNotify">notification forms</a> mentioned below and submit them together.</p>

        <h3>Are there situations where I am not required to notify CRA of the disposition of a property?</h3>
<p>Since March&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2010, if you have disposed of certain properties that do not derive their value principally from real or immovable property situated in Canada, you do not have to notify&nbsp;the CRA of the disposition. See <a href="#Changes">Changes to Taxable Canadian Property</a> below.</p>
<p>If you have disposed of a property that is fully treaty-protected under any treaty that Canada has with another country, you may not be required to notify&nbsp;the CRA of the disposition. Please see the section <a href="#purchasers">Canadian and Non-resident purchasers acquiring certain Treaty-protected property from Non-residents of Canada</a>.</p>






        <h3>What should I send the CRA?</h3>
<p>Send the form that applies to your situation to CRA within the allowed time. <strong>Be sure to provide the necessary supporting documentation</strong> as outlined on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062.html">Form T2062</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062a.html">Form T2062A</a>. Missing documentation will delay the issuance of your Certificate of Compliance.</p>
<p>If you are letting&nbsp;the CRA know about an <strong>actual disposition</strong> and you provide the payment to cover the resulting tax payable, or <a href="#Whatisacceptablesecurity">acceptable security</a>,&nbsp;the CRA&nbsp;will issue you a certificate of compliance, Form&nbsp;T2068, <em>Certificate - The Disposition of Property by a Non-Resident of Canada</em>.</p>
<p>If you are letting&nbsp;the CRA know about a <strong>proposed disposition</strong> and you provide either the payment to cover the resulting tax payable or <a href="#Whatisacceptablesecurity">acceptable security</a>,&nbsp;the CRA will issue you a certificate of compliance, Form T2064, <em>Certificate - Proposed Disposition of Property by a Non-Resident of Canada</em>.</p>
<p>When you actually dispose of the property, if the facts and amounts of the actual disposition differ from those you reported to&nbsp;the CRA for the proposed disposition, you should send&nbsp;to the CRA another completed form with the changes and provide&nbsp;the CRA with <a href="#Whatisacceptablesecurity">acceptable security</a> or any additional payment to cover the increase in tax payable.&nbsp;The CRA&nbsp;will then issue you a certificate of compliance, Form T2068.</p>









        <h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>Non-resident vendors who fail to notify CRA of the disposition within the 10&nbsp;day period will be liable to a penalty under subsection 162(7) of the Act. This penalty is&nbsp;$25 a day for each day the notification is late, with a minimum of&nbsp;$100 and a maximum of&nbsp;$2,500.</p>
<p>For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/competent-authority-agreements-notices/failure-comply-penalty-non-resident-vendor-notification-on-disposition-taxable-canadian-property.html">Failure to comply penalty - Non-resident vendor notification on the disposition of taxable Canadian property</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not let&nbsp;the CRA know about your disposition, and a Certificate of Compliance (Form&nbsp;T2064 or Form&nbsp;T2068) is not issued, the purchaser may become liable to pay a specified amount of tax that arises from the disposition on behalf of the vendor. In this case, the purchaser is entitled to withhold 25% (50% on certain types of property) of the proceeds minus the amount of the certificate limit, if any, from the proceeds.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h3>When do I have to file my Canadian Income tax return?</h3>
<p>Generally, if you have disposed of a taxable Canadian property (TCP), you are required to file a tax return.</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-resident <strong>individuals</strong> must file their Canadian income tax return by April 30 of the year following the year in which the disposition took place. Copy 2 of the Certificate of Compliance must be attached to the return.</li>
<li>Non-resident <strong>corporations</strong> must file their Canadian income tax return within six months after the end of the taxation year in which the disposition took place. The taxation year of a corporation is its fiscal period.</li>
<li>Non-resident <strong>trusts</strong> must file their Canadian income tax return within 90 days after the end of the trust's taxation year in which the disposition took place.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you are not required to file a tax return for the year if <strong>all</strong> of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are a non-resident of Canada</li>
<li>no tax is payable for the tax year in which you have disposed of the property</li>
<li>you are not liable to pay any amount to&nbsp;the CRA for any previous tax year</li>
<li>each Canadian property you have disposed of in the tax year is<ul>
<li><a href="#Excluded">excluded property</a></li>
<li>a property for which you were not required to remit an amount or provide acceptable security for the CRA to issue a Form&nbsp;T2064 or Form&nbsp;T2068 (Certificate of Compliance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>





        <h3 id="Whatisacceptablesecurity">What is acceptable security?</h3>
<p>As an alternative to the immediate payment of tax,&nbsp;the CRA may accept adequate security for the tax as an interim arrangement.</p>
<p>If you need more information about acceptable security, you or your representative should contact the Revenue Collections Division of the applicable <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">Tax Services Office</a>.</p>





        <h2 id="Changes">Changes to Taxable Canadian Property</h2>
<p><strong>What has changed with respect to taxable Canadian property?</strong></p>
<p>The definition of taxable Canadian property was amended for dispositions after <span class="nowrap">March&nbsp;4, 2010,</span> to exclude certain properties that would normally be eligible for an exemption under one of Canada's existing tax treaties. This change applies to certain properties that do not derive their value, currently or within the previous 60 months, principally from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada. These properties include certain:</p>
<ul>
<li>shares of corporations</li>
<li>interests in a trust</li>
<li>units of a unit trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does this change apply if the non-resident who owns the property is a resident of a country with which Canada does not have a tax treaty?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, these changes apply to all taxpayers.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to notify CRA if I disposed of my shares of a corporation?</strong></p>
<p>If the shares do not derive their value, currently or within the previous 60&nbsp;months, principally from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada, you will not be required to notify the CRA of the disposition.</p>
<p><strong>I purchased shares of a corporation from a non-resident who did not obtain a Certificate of Compliance; will I be required to withhold a portion of the purchase price?</strong></p>
<p>If the shares do not derive their value, currently or within the previous 60&nbsp;months, principally from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada, you will not be required to withhold a portion of the purchase price.</p>
<p><strong>How will I determine if the property that I own derives its value, currently or within the previous 60 months, principally from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada?</strong></p>
<p>For shares of a corporation, obtain a declaration from the corporation certifying that the value of the shares is not principally derived, and has not been for the previous 60&nbsp;months, from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada.</p>
<p>For a capital interest in a trust or a unit of a unit trust, obtain a declaration from the trust that the value of the trust is not principally derived, and has not been for the previous 60&nbsp;months, from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada.</p>






        <h2 id="purchasers">Canadian and Non-resident purchasers acquiring certain <span class="nowrap">Treaty-protected</span> property from Non-residents of Canada</h2>
 <p><strong>These procedures apply to the acquisition of treaty-protected property after <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2008.</span> </strong></p>






        <h3>What is treaty-protected property?</h3>
 <p>Most <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/tax-treaties.html">tax treaties</a> allow Canada to tax the income or gains only on Canadian real and resources properties and on shares of companies that derive most of their value from such properties. As a result, Canada is prevented from taxing other types of property that would normally be taxable under the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (the&nbsp;Act). As of January 1, 2009, if the income or gain from the disposition of the property is fully exempt under Part&nbsp;I of the Act because of a tax treaty that Canada has with the country of residence of the vendor, the property is treaty-protected.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h3>Do I need a taxation number?</h3>
 <p>You are not required to have a taxation number to notify CRA of the acquisition of a treaty-protected property from a Non-resident of Canada. However, if you have previously been issued a SIN, TTN, ITN, BN, or Trust number, please indicate it on the submitted <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062c.html">Form T2062C, Notification of an Acquisition from a Non-Resident Vendor of Treaty-Protected Property</a>.</p>




        <h3>When should I notify the CRA of the acquisition of treaty-protected property from a Non-resident of Canada?</h3>
<p>If you and the vendor are related (see note below), you <strong>are required</strong> to send <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062c.html">Form T2062C</a> within 30 days of the date of purchase of the property. If you do not send the form within 30 days, the notification will be invalid and the vendor will be required to notify&nbsp;the CRA of the disposition.</p>
<p>For a transaction between non-related parties, the vendor is not required to advise CRA of the disposition and the purchaser is not required to advise CRA of the acquisition. However, after determining the vendor's country of residence for treaty purposes by reasonable inquiry (see part D of <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062c.html">Form T2062C</a>) and establishing that the Canadian property is treaty-protected property, if you want to reduce the potential for the purchaser liability , you may notify&nbsp;the CRA with Form T2062C within 30 days from the date of acquisition. If you do not send the form within 30 days, the notification will be invalid.</p>
<p>If the property is not, in fact, treaty-protected, the CRA may assess a purchaser liability. However, the CRA will generally not issue such an assessment if the purchaser has filed Form T2062C, is unrelated to the vendor and has made every reasonable effort to determine that the property qualifies as treaty-protected.</p>
<p>Generally,&nbsp;the CRA will not acknowledge that&nbsp;the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2062c.html">Form T2062C</a> has been received. However, you will be advised if Form T2062C is late-filed as these notifications are invalid.</p>

        <h3>Purchaser's liability</h3>
 <p>If a Certificate of Compliance (Form T2064 or Form T2068) is not issued and the property is not excluded property, the purchaser may become liable to pay a specified amount of tax that arises from the disposition on behalf of the vendor. In this case, the purchaser is entitled to withhold 25% (50% on certain types of property) of the proceeds minus the amount of the certificate limit, if any, from the proceeds.</p>  <p>For more information on purchaser's liability, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic72-17r6.html">Information Circular IC72-17, Procedures Concerning the Disposition of Taxable Canadian Property by Non-Residents of Canada - Section 116</a>.</p>
